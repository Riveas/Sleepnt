# Sleepnt - app that won't let you fall asleep
Sleepnt is a simple app written entirely in python that might come handy when the deadline is tight and day is short. 
Main usage of the app would be to prevent falling asleep when there's still some things to do but all you can think of is falling asleep. 
With this project every time you'll close your eyes for other purpose than blinking, you'll be reminded with sound alarm that it's not time for sleeping yet.
